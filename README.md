# Cryptographic Treasure Hunt - Drestein'24 üèÜ

Welcome to the repository for our **Cryptographic Treasure Hunt**, organized as part of **Drestein'24**, where we successfully conducted innovative puzzles involving cryptographic encryption, audio ciphers, fake URLs, and more! This repository captures the code, ideas, and documentation of our event, which won the **Best Event Award** at the festival. üéâ

## üóùÔ∏è Overview
This event blended computer science, cryptography, and creativity to create a thrilling treasure hunt experience. Participants solved challenges that required:
- **Cryptographic Encryption**: Unveiling clues using advanced cryptography techniques like Caesar Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and XOR-based encryption.
- **Audio Ciphers**: Hidden messages in audio files, decoded using spectrograms and other techniques.
- **Fake URLs**: Decoding encrypted URLs that led to hidden web pages with critical hints.
- **Binary and Hex Clues**: Hidden data in binary and hexadecimal formats.
- **Geographic Coordinates**: Real-world locations encoded into puzzles.
- **Image Steganography**: Extracting text or clues hidden in images.

## üåü Highlights
- **Interactive Challenges**: Participants explored cryptographic concepts while racing against time to solve each puzzle.
- **Immersive Storyline**: A captivating narrative guided participants through the challenges, making the event engaging and unforgettable.
- **Diverse Puzzles**: Each clue incorporated unique problem-solving techniques, ensuring an intellectually stimulating experience.
- **Award-Winning Execution**: Recognized as the Best Event at Drestein'24 for its innovation and impact.
